      <h2>Dog</h2>
      <p>
        The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris, when considered a subspecies
        of the grey wolf, or Canis familiaris, when considered a distinct
        species).

      <h2 class="clear">Cats</h2>
      <p>
        The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small,
        typically furry, carnivorous mammal. When kept as indoor pets, domestic
        cats are often called house cats or simply cats when there is no need to
        distinguish them from other felids and felines. Humans often value
        domestic cats for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.
        Various cat registries recognise more than seventy cat breeds.
